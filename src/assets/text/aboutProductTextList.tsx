    { header: "Social Media", description: "We have built a way for kids to safely connect with their friends online, in a way where status is tied to achieving your goals and learning, rather than likes and follower counts. Kids can share what they have achieved and what interests them, teaching them that it is their mind that matters - rather than their bodily image." },
    { header: "Internet Browsing", description: "Our platform curates the internet for kids - cutting out all the junk like unboxing videos, while finding the best engaging educational content that fits each kid’s interests. In this way, kids can engage with all the human knowledge on the internet, without falling into addictive spirals." },
    { header: "Mentorship", description: "Technology has the potential to connect kids with world-class experts. In the past, having highly accomplished people tutor kids 1-1 was the norm. We’re bringing this back with our mentorship services. " }
