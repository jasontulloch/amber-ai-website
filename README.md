# Amber AI Website

This project was started by Jason Tulloch as an application for the Software Developer Intern role

## General

Upon reviewing https://www.helloamber.ai/ I decided that I could make an immediate impact for Amber AI by refactoring the existing website. Given the lack of access to the domain, this project focused on UI/UX improvements, not any updates or use of APIs (e.g an email form, sign in, etc.). I hope this project demonstrates my interest in learning more about Amber AI and potentially joining the team. My engineering experience includes React (this project albeit there wasn't really any complexities or state to manage), React Native, MongoDB, Node JS, PHP + Laravel, and miscellaneous Python scripts. As a recent founder, I understand the stress of trying to grow a business. This project is available to Amber AI whether I am hired or not.
